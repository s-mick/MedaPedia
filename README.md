# MedaPedia #

I use this repository to host and edit online some data from my own world building project, rather than to offer public access to this creative work. GitHub is quite convenient for this use, and as I don't need nor want a Premium account allowing the creation of private repositories, I settled for a public one.

## License ##

My creative work consists of anything written in French in the contents of this repository's files. For the moment, it is not under any license and remains under my exclusive copyright, by default. Serious contributions requests, if any, might be considered, on a case-by-case basis.

All the rest is taken from [TimelineJS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) source code or documentation, and is not concerned by the absence of license (see [TimelineJS license](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS3/blob/master/LICENSE)).
