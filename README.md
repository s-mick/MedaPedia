# MedaPedia #

I use this repository to host some data related to my own world-building project. The goal isn't really to offer public access to this creative work, but GitHub is quite convenient for few-file hosting, and as I don't need nor want a Premium account, required to create private repositories, I settled for a public one.

## License ##

My creative work consists of anything written in French in the contents of this repository (mostly JSON files). For the moment, it is not under any license and **remains under my exclusive copyright**, by default. Serious contribution proposals (if any) might be considered, on a case-by-case basis.

The rest (PHP and HTML files, including JavaScript source code) is taken or adapted from publicly available code samples but is not concerned by the absence of license. See:
* [TimelineJS](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS3/blob/master/LICENSE)
* [GoJS](https://gojs.net/latest/license)
